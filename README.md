# Hello, nerds ðŸ‘‹

I code to solve problems, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with React.js _as humanly possible_. I also love learning/playing on my fender stratocaster ðŸŽ¸.

A science, and music enthusiast. I work at [Rill Data](https://rilldata.com/), too. If you would like to discuss these things, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashshkapoor).
